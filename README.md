# ubuntuAntiAfk
Script using keep-presence package to prevent system from detecting afk. Files must be in same directory, ideally on desktop. Originally intended for websocket-based VNC
 clients that may kill connections due to inactivity. Make the click-script allowable by right click, change the permission of the shell file to allow others to read and write, and check the executable box of said file.
